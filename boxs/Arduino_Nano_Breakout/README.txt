# Summary

Arduino Nano breakout box and lid.
Mount this box to a din rail
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1688532

I cut the walls off of the box to make a tray. 
And the mounts too.
Put some rubber feet under this tray and you can place a breakout board in it and sit it on your workbench or desk without fear of the solder lugs underneath shorting or touching something bad.

REVISION:

I remixed my breakout box a little. 
I removed the 2 oval holes.
This box is still 30mm's tall.
I made a shorter version also, 20mm's tall with wiring cut outs.
The lid is the same.
The tray is the same.
Except for
I added holes to screw down the breakout board, and din rail brackets..
I did this for all 3.

I also remixed 60x40-PerfBoardMount thing:2761904 by ValarmLLC   
Just a little.
I removed the original mounting tabs and added my din rail mount tabs and I made a lid for it.
